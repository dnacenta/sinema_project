# Sinema Project

Ruby on Rails app. Matches friends and films.

Create a group and add your friends, those ones who love films.

You will be able to check the latest films out or even add your favourite ones. Then the group pick the ones that want to watch and do the matching between the friends who want to watch the film.

Then you will be able to organise yourselves and choose a date to watch it.

Still in progress.
